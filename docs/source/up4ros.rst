The up4ros Node
===============

.. _up4ros:


The main component of this repository is the up4ros `ROS <https://www.ros.org/>`_ package. 
This node is a ROS wrapper for the AIPlan4EU Unified Planning library available 
at `this link <https://github.com/aiplan4eu/unified-planning>`_ and exposes the following actions and services:

Actions
-------


PDDLPlanOneShotAction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This action takes in input a pddl problem and domain and tries to use one of the registered planners to produce a solution in the feedback. 
The result will tell us if the planner managed or not to find a solution.

This action takes in input a problem name which should be known by the running up4ros node and tries to use one of the registered planners to produce a solution in the feedback.
The result will tell us if the planner managed or not to find a solution.

Services
--------

Services are used to handle and manage planning problems interactively at runtime.
In particular, the up4ros node exposes the following services:

AddAction
^^^^^^^^^

This service adds an action to a currently defined domain. The service is defined as:

.. code-block:: console

    string problem_name
    up_msgs/Action action
    ---
    bool success
    string message

where the action is defined as:

.. code-block:: console
        
    ## Unified action representation that represents any kind of actions.

    # Action name. E.g. "move"
    string name

    # Typed and named parameters of the action.
    up_msgs/Parameter[] parameters

    # If set, the action is durative. Otherwise it is instantaneous.
    # features: DURATIVE_ACTIONS
    up_msgs/Duration[] duration

    # Conjunction of conditions that must hold for the action to be applicable.
    up_msgs/Condition[] conditions

    # Conjunction of effects as a result of applying this action.
    up_msgs/Effect[] effects


AddFluent
^^^^^^^^^

This service adds a fluent to one of the problems known to the node. The service is defined as:

.. code-block:: console

    string problem_name
    up_msgs/Fluent fluent
    up_msgs/Expression default_value
    ---
    bool success
    string message

where a fluent is defined as:

.. code-block:: console

    ## A state-dependent variable.
    string name
    # Return type of the fluent.
    string value_type
    # Typed and named parameters of the fluent.
    up_msgs/Parameter[] parameters

    # If non-empty, then any state variable using this fluent that is not explicitly given a value in the initial state
    # will be assumed to have this default value.
    # This allows mimicking the closed world assumption by setting a "false" default value to predicates.
    # Note that in the initial state of the problem message, it is assumed that all default values are set.
    up_msgs/Expression[] default_value

while an expression is defined as:

.. code-block:: console

    up_msgs/ExpressionItem[] expressions
    uint8[] level


AddGoal
^^^^^^^

This service adds a new goal to one of the problems known by the node. The service is defined as:

.. code-block:: console

    string problem_name
    up_msgs/Goal[] goal
    up_msgs/GoalWithCost[] goal_with_cost
    ---
    bool success
    string message

where a goal is defined as:

.. code-block:: console

    ## A Goal is currently an expression that must hold either:
    ## - in the final state,
    ## - over a specific temporal interval (under the `timed_goals` features)

    # Goal expression that must hold in the final state.
    up_msgs/Expression goal

    # Optional. If specified the goal should hold over the specified temporal interval (instead of on the final state).
    # features: TIMED_GOALS
    up_msgs/TimeInterval[] timing


and a goal with cost is defined as:

.. code-block:: console

    ## Represents a goal associated with a cost, used to define oversubscription planning.

    # Goal expression
    up_msgs/Expression goal
    # The cost
    up_msgs/Real cost


AddObject
^^^^^^^^^
This service adds a new object to one of the problems known by the node. The service is defined as:

.. code-block:: console

    string problem_name
    up_msgs/ObjectDeclaration object
    ---
    bool success
    string message

where an object is defined as:

.. code-block:: console

    ## Declares an object with the given name and type.

    # Name of the object.
    string name 
    # Type of the object.
    # The type must have been previously declared in the problem definition.
    string type
